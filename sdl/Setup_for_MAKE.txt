Setting up to compile Fractint port to SDL

Linux:

Run: sudo apt-get install build-essential

The following packages (and their dependencies) are needed:
  libsdl2-dev
  libsdl2-2.0-0
  libsdl2-ttf2.0-0
  libsdl2-ttf-dev

Ubuntu 14.04 has these packages, 16.04 does not, 18.04 does.
  On a Debian based system (like Ubuntu):
  Need to run: sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
  Need to run: sudo apt-get install libsdl2-ttf-dev
  Need to run: sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0
  Need to run: sudo apt-get install libsdl2-ttf2.0-0
