Setting up Code::Blocks to complile Fractint port to SDL

Download from:
 http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/5

For Windows 2000 / XP / Vista:
 codeblocks-10.05mingw-setup.exe

Run this file to install.  I picked the default installation.

For SDL:
Download from:
 http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php

 SDL-devel-1.2.14-mingw32.tar.gz (Mingw32)
  Unpack to C drive.  Will create C:\SDL-1.2.14

 SDL-1.2.14-win32.zip
  Contains SDL.dll, which must be in your working directory
   (Will be included in fractint svn checkout)

For SDL_image:
Download from:
 http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/

 SDL_image-1.2.10.zip
  Unpack and copy SDL_image.h to:
   C:\SDL-1.2.14\include\SDL

 SDL_image-1.2.10-win32.zip
  Unpack and copy SDL_image.dll and libpng12-0.dll to your working directory
   (Will be included in fractint svn checkout)

For SDL_ttf:
Download from:
 http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/

 SDL_ttf-2.0.9-win32.zip
  Unpack and copy SDL_ttf.dll to your working directory
   (Will be included in fractint svn checkout)

 SDL_ttf-2.0.9.zip
  Unpack and copy SDL_ttf.h to:
   C:\SDL-1.2.14\include\SDL



Windows Project options:

Include directories:

  C:\SDL-1.2.14\include\SDL

Library directories:

  C:\SDL-1.2.14\lib


linker options
  -lmingw32
  -lSDLmain
  -lSDL
  -lSDL_image.dll
  -lSDL_ttf.dll

These should all be set if you open the fractint.workspace in Code::Blocks

Linux:
The following packages (and their dependencies) are needed:
  codeblocks
  codeblocks-contrib
  libsdl1.2-dev
  libsdl1.2debian
  libsdl1.2debian-alsa
  libsdl-image1.2
  libsdl-image1.2-dev
  libsdl-ttf2.0-0
  libsdl-ttf2.0-dev

Kubuntu 11.10 has these packages.
If your distribution doesn't, download SDL-1.2.14-1.x86_64.rpm
or SDL-1.2.14-1.i586.rpm
  if necessary, repackage to debian (I used alien)

Linux Project options:

Compiler settings:

  Other options:
    -fno-builtin

  #defines
    XFRACT

Search directories:

  headers
  /usr/include/SDL

Link libraries:

  SDLmain
  SDL_image
  SDL_ttf

These should all be set if you open the xfractint.workspace in Code::Blocks
