Setting up Code::Blocks to complile Fractint port to SDL

Download from:
 http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/5

For Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8.x /10:
 codeblocks-16.01-setup.exe

Run this file to install.  I picked the default installation.

For SDL (32-bit):
Download from:
 www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php

 SDL2-devel-2.0.4-mingw32.tar.gz (Mingw 32/64-bit)
  Unpack to C:\SDL.  Will create C:\SDL\SDL-2.0.4.
  The i686-w64-mingw32 subfolder contains the 32-bit files we need.

 SDL2-2.0.4-win32-x86.zip
  Contains SDL.dll, which must be in your working directory
   (Will be included in fractint svn checkout)

For SDL_ttf:
Download from:
 www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/

 SDL2_ttf-devel-2.0.14-mingw.tar.gz (MinGW 32/64-bit)
  Unpack to c:\SDL.  Will create c:\SDL\SDL2_ttf-2.0.14
  The i686-w64-mingw32 subfolder contains the 32-bit files we need.

 SDL2_ttf-2.0.14-win32-x86.zip
  Unpack and copy SDL2_ttf.dll to your working directory
   (Will be included in fractint svn checkout)


Windows Project options:

Under Compiler settings
  Other compiler options
    -fno-builtin

Under Linker settings
  Link libraries:
    mingw32
    SDL2main
    SDL2
    SDL2_ttf

Under Search directories
  Compiler
    C:\SDL\SDL2-2.0.4\i686-w64-mingw32\include\SDL2
    C:\SDL\SDL2_ttf-2.0.14\i686-w64-mingw32\include\SDL2
    headers
  Linker
    C:\SDL\SDL2-2.0.4\i686-w64-mingw32\lib
    C:\SDL\SDL2_ttf-2.0.14\i686-w64-mingw32\lib

These should all be set if you open the fractint.workspace in Code::Blocks


Linux:
The following packages (and their dependencies) are needed:
  codeblocks
  codeblocks-contrib
  libsdl1.2-dev
  libsdl1.2debian
  libsdl1.2debian-alsa
  libsdl-image1.2
  libsdl-image1.2-dev
  libsdl-ttf2.0-0
  libsdl-ttf2.0-dev

Kubuntu 11.10 has these packages.
If your distribution doesn't, download SDL-1.2.14-1.x86_64.rpm
or SDL-1.2.14-1.i586.rpm
  if necessary, repackage to debian (I used alien)

Linux Project options:

Compiler settings:

  Other options:
    -fno-builtin

  #defines
    XFRACT

Search directories:

  headers
  /usr/include/SDL

Link libraries:

  SDLmain
  SDL_image
  SDL_ttf

These should all be set if you open the xfractint.workspace in Code::Blocks
